# Author's note (13/10/2019)
This was a mind numbing project for me. I encountered tons of problems while trying to build the project. However, even if it was really frustrating spending hours trying to solve countless issues, it taught me a lot. I am starting to understand Room and Coroutines more. It is really exciting to know that I am a step closer to what I aspire to be. I know that this app won't make it to the playstore leaderboards, but it taught me something. The more I fail, the greater I learned and that is what is important.
